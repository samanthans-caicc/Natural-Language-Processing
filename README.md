# Natural-Language-Processing
CS 6263 Spring 2026

This repository is going to be used for as an archive for all the python (.py) code for the class Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models.

For a cleaner environment (I guess), a venv might be needed to be activated each time a terminal will open. The code is as follows.
1. Clean the system for safety: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
